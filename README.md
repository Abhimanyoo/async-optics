async_optics 1.0.0


async_optics is an asynchronous code viewer, performance monitor, and package monitor for applications that use Node.js.
It is able to track and monitor asynchronous functions with Node.js' Async Hooks and Perf Hooks. *The aggregated information
is displayed in a Sankey diagram with hierarchical behavior for asynchronous functions and as a Sunburst graph for
information of package monitoring.* The Sankey diagram handles real-time changes for live testing and allows hovering
capabilities to show specific information on desired functions on a lower panel.
